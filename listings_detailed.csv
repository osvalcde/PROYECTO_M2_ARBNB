For me Airbnb is a way to meet and get in touch with new people.
I love hosting and meeting new people. I want my guests to enjoy something special of Milan and have a 5 stars Airbnb experience. 
Based on my travelling experience (both for work and pleasure) I defined the 6 MUSTs of my apts:
1)  they must express something of the TRUE MILAN: each apt has something which, as a  tourist in my first years in Milan, I loved (the fantastic view which is very difficult to find in Milan, the old courts, ...)
2) they must be a place where I WOULD LOVE TO LIVE (the studio with Duomo view is in the same building where I live with my family, of course in a separate apt!)
3) they must be CENTRAL: walking distance to most attractions, close to bars/restaurants/aperitivos, close to connections to airports and stations
4) they must be CLEAN: when I travel (as a tourist) the cleaning is the first requirement I have!
5) they must be AFFORDABLE for most tourists, without any unexpected expenses and with all comforts (airconditioning, towels, linen, hair dryer, washing machine, iron, ... and of course free WIFI!!!)
6) they must be in a SAFE area: Milan is not a very dangerous town, but, being father of 3 kids, I have chosen the location in an area where I am expecting my sons can walk alone in the evening.

Mi piace la gente e se ho il tempo di fare due chiacchiere con gli ospiti e bere un caffé insieme, mi fa molto piacere .... sempre che gli ospiti ne abbiano voglia. Penso che la privacy sia importante e a casa nostra non sarete disturbati, ma per qualunque esigenza o consiglio sono volentieri disponibile. 
Amo la musica e ballare. Mi piace leggere, stare nella natura, viaggiare, stare con gli amici e conoscere gente nuova. Mi piace mangiare e adoro la cucina italiana, ma essendo curiosa amo anche la cucina di tutto il mondo.
